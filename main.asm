; 1. Add from 1, 2, â€¦ to XX, and store in LATA.
;    Tips: 
;        a. Use WREG as a incrementally temporary register.
;        b. ADDWF is a good instruction for sum of two registers.
;        c. If there are nothing change about Overflow Bit in STATUS register, Branch back and do this sum loop.
;        d. Use above Control Operation and see the result, what happen? And what is the value of XX finally?
;           ANS: 16
; 
; 2. After finishing the summation, use GOTO to the label named Rotate. And label Rotate must under these:
;    NOP
;    NOP
;    NOP
;    GOTO Initial
; 3. Give value 0xBF to your LATB register, and do any one of following two options:
;    Option A: Rotate Left and store in WREG, C = 1, what is result?
;        ANS: b'00011110
;    Option B: Rotate Right and store in WREG, C = 1, what is result?
;    Take Care about your STATUS register
